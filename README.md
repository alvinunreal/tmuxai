## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://tmuxai.dev/shots/vim-docker-compose.png)

TmuxAI is an intelligent terminal assistant that lives inside your tmux sessions. Unlike other CLI AI tools, TmuxAI directly observes and understands the content of your tmux panes in real-time, providing contextual assistance without requiring you to change your workflow or interrupt your terminal sessions.

Think of TmuxAI as a _pair programmer_ that sits beside you, watching your terminal environment exactly as you see it. It can understand what you're working on across multiple panes, help solve problems, and execute commands on your behalf in a dedicated execution pane.

### Human-Inspired Interface

TmuxAI's design philosophy mirrors the way humans collaborate at the terminal. Just as a colleague sitting next to you would observe your screen, understand context from what's visible, and help accordingly, TmuxAI:

1. **Observes**: Reads the visible content in all your panes
2. **Communicates**: Uses a dedicated chat pane for interaction
3. **Acts**: Can execute commands in a separate execution pane (with your permission)

This approach provides powerful AI assistance while respecting your existing workflow and maintaining the familiar terminal environment you're already comfortable with.

## Installation

TmuxAI requires only tmux to be installed on your system. It's designed to work on Unix-based operating systems including Linux and macOS.

### Quick Install

The fastest way to install TmuxAI is using the installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.tmuxai.dev | bash
```

This installs TmuxAI to `/usr/local/bin/tmuxai` by default. If you need to install to a different location or want to see what the script does before running it, you can view the source at [get.tmuxai.dev](https://get.tmuxai.dev).

### Homebrew

If you use Homebrew, you can install TmuxAI with:

```bash
brew tap alvinunreal/tmuxai
brew install tmuxai
```

### Manual Download

You can also download pre-built binaries from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alvinunreal/tmuxai/releases).

After downloading, make the binary executable and move it to a directory in your PATH:

```bash
chmod +x ./tmuxai
sudo mv ./tmuxai /usr/local/bin/
```

## Post-Installation Setup

After installing TmuxAI, you need to configure your API key to start using it:

1. **Set the API Key**  
   TmuxAI uses the OpenRouter endpoint by default. Set your API key by adding the following to your shell configuration (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):

   ```bash
   export TMUXAI_OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

2. **Start TmuxAI**

   ```bash
   tmuxai
   ```

3. **Default Configuration**
   By default, TmuxAI is configured to use the OpenRouter endpoint with the `google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview` model. You can customize these settings via the config.yaml file. For details, see the example configuration at [config.example.yaml](https://github.com/alvinunreal/tmuxai/blob/main/config.example.yaml).
